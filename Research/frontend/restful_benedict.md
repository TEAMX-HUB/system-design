# API CONSUMPTION WITH RESTFUL API

**API consumption** simply refers to the usage and interaction with services provided by the API through HTTP requests to retrieve and manipulate data servers and/or web services.

RESTful APIs follow the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), which is an architectural style for designing networked applications. HTTP methods like *GET, POST, PUT, DELETE,* + etc., are used by RESTful API  to perform various actions on resources provided by the API.

During API Consumption, HTTP requests are made to specific URLâ€™s provided by the API to retrieve, submit, update and/or delete resources. In the same vane the responses received are handled by the API. Responses are usually in the form of JSON or XML data, containing the requested information or status of the requested action.
 Developers often consume RESTful APIs in their applications to access data and services provided by external systems or services. To do this, they use programming languages and libraries that can handle HTTP requests and responses, such as Python's requests library, JavaScript's fetch API, or other language-specific HTTP client libraries.

**Few Basic RESTful API methods used and what they do:**

1. GET

- Used to retrieve data from the server. For example, you might use a GET request to retrieve information about a user, product, or any other resource.

2. POST:

- Used to submit data to the server to create new resources. For example, you might use a POST request to create a new user account or post a comment.

3. PUT

- Used to update existing resources on the server. For example, you might use a PUT request to update a user's profile information.

4. DELETE

- Used to delete resources on the server. For example, you might use a DELETE request to remove a user account.
